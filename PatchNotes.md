Hi! This is a file that will contain all patch notes for my gamemode! I will try to format these notes similarly to actual patch notes in Overwatch. Please contact me on discord, twitter, or even email me at ItsZenEXE@pm.me with "OWStrife" at the start of the subject line if you have any questions!

Newer patches will be at the top!


# PATCH NOTES – APRIL 27, 2020

For this first official patch note that's being saved, I'm actually going to put **everything changed from the base game of Overwatch**. This will be a long one, as lots of work has been put into this mode as a whole in the past.

## GENERAL UPDATES
### Engine/Stability
#### Workshop
- Disabled Inspector recording
- Added Optional Features
	-   Added Debug mode on workshop maps
		- This is **for testing only** and is disabled by default.
		- Only works correctly for host player
			- Attempting to use Debug Mode with more than just the host player can and will cause bugs!
		- Debug mode auto-disables with more than the host player on the server
	- Added Debug Damage Testing bots
	- Added Debug Status/Ability Testing bot
	>Developer Comment:
	>- These bots are extremely very primitive in it's current state. It only allows spawning 1 or 2 enemies at once that don't really do anything, and you need to edit the code for the center testing bot in order to make it do things. It currently is mainly for testing stun interactions, damage, and knockback.
- Added anti-crash system
	- The game slows down upon reaching too high of a server load and returns to normal speed when it is able to handle everything more!
- Added some host-only cheats
	- These are disabled by default

#### General
- Saying voiceline up will give per hero info
	>Developer Comment:
	>- This will allow players to quickly learn what each character does upon choosing them, as well as give tips
- Pre-Match setup is 15 seconds down from 25



## HERO UPDATES
### General
- Ultimate charge resets to 0% upon death

### Ana
#### Biotic Grenade
- Throwing the grenade down and hitting yourself with the grenade launches you up in the air
>Developer Comment:
>- This is planned to be used as an escape or to get to higher ground which is useful to get better angles as a sniper

### Ashe
#### General
- Damage Dealt lowered to 85%

#### The Viper
- Ammunition Clip Size raised from 15 to 20

#### Coach gun
- Enemy knockback lowered to 50%

- Can be used a second time 2.25 seconds after first activation
>Developer Comment:
>- These changes are aimed to increase mobility for Ashe, making her unpredictable and harder to pin down. She also can strategically use this to get around corners and play both defensively or agressively.
