# ItsZenEXE Overwatch Gamemode

This is ItsZen_EXE's OW Gamemode code

To use it in-game, start a custom game, press settings, copy the contents of the file ''OWGamemode.txt'' and select import settings

Optionally, you can use the ''OWGamemmodeEarlyBuild'' for the newest saved build. Warning, it will probably be much more unstable!

You can find a Trello updater for this gamemode at https://trello.com/b/cEKaYUzL/itszenexes-custom-overwatch-gamemode

Also, there is now push updates for this on my discord server!
