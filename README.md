# ItsZenEXE Overwatch Gamemode

This is ItsZen_EXE's OW Gamemode code

To use it in-game, start a custom game, press settings, copy the contents of the file ''OWGamemode.txt'' and select import settings

Optionally, you can use the ''OWGamemmodeEarlyBuild'' for the newest saved build. Warning, it will probably be much more unstable!
