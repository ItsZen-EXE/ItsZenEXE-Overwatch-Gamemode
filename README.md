# ItsZenEXE Overwatch Gamemode

This is ItsZen_EXE's OW Gamemode code

To use it in-game, start a custom game, press settings, copy the contents of the file [OWStrife.txt](OWStrife.txt) and select import settings

If there is a PTR update on Overwatch, this will most likely be updated to use that update!

You can find a Patch Notes for this custom game at [PatchNotes.md](PatchNotes.md)

My discord server should also get updates automatically on my progress!
